To replace the layout for a different one just copy the config folder from the layout of your choosing in the Alt_Configs and paste and replace the one in the mods root folder.

ONLY COPY AND REPLACE.
DO NOT DELETE THE CONFIG FOLDER IN THE MODS ROOT FOLDER(RW_SimpleUI-Toolbelt-NO/Config).
IT CONTAINS NEEDED FILES THAT THE ALT CONFIGS DO NOT HAVE.

EXAMPLE:

Copy the Config folder from the HUD with toolbelt numbers layout found below
RW_SimpleUI-Toolbelt-NO/Alt_Configs/HUD/2Toolbelt_Numbers/Config

Then just paste and replace the mods config folder. Say yes to replace windows.xml when asked. The folder listed below is the one you replace.
RW_SimpleUI-Toolbelt-NO/Config
